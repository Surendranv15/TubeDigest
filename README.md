#PROBLEM STATEMENT
            A tremendous volume of video recordings is created and shared on YouTube every day. Watching movies that end up being much 
longer than expected can be quite time-consuming, and occasionally our efforts may be in vain if we are unable to learn anything beneficial from them.
            We can quickly identify the main points of these videos by summarizing the transcripts, which will also save us time and energy by preventing 
us from having to view the full thing.
